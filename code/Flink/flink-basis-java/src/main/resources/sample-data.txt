Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine
for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams
Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments
perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale
Flink provides exactly-once processing semantics for most of its operators
It offers low latency, high throughput, and exactly-once processing guarantees
Flink supports both batch and stream processing in a unified way
The framework is highly fault-tolerant and can recover from failures quickly
Flink integrates well with many popular data sources and sinks
including Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, Amazon S3, and many others
Flink applications can be written in Java, Scala, Python, and SQL
The community around Flink is very active and growing rapidly
Flink is used by many large companies for their real-time analytics needs
It provides powerful windowing capabilities for time-based computations
Flink also supports complex event processing and machine learning workloads
